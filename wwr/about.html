            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Early 2000s:
                Adventure Rapids Rafting Company was founded by a 
                group of friends who shared a passion for whitewater 
                adventure. Starting with a few rafts and a prime 
                location near River Explorer National Park, they 
                introduced people to the thrill of river rafting.
                Mid-2000s:
                Their reputation grew quickly as they expanded 
                their fleet and hired experienced guides, focusing 
                on safety and enjoyment. They also embraced 
                environmental responsibility, partnering with 
                local conservation groups.
                2010s:
                Adventure Rapids became a top choice for river 
                adventures, offering various rafting experiences. 
                They adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic by 
                implementing safety measures and continued to 
                provide memorable trips.
                Present Day:
                Today, Adventure Rapids is a respected name 
                in rafting. They offer team-building 
                adventures, educational programs, and 
                environmental initiatives, staying true 
                to their mission of sharing the joy of 
                rafting and preserving nature.
