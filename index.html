        <p> Hello! I'm Ezra Taft Brigham Essien, a driven software programming student with a 
            flair for web development and a passion for writing codes and playing around with them. 
            I'm currently advancing my skills as I pursue a degree in Computer Software Engineering 
            at Brigham Young University. I'm on a constant quest to innovate and learn. I love playing 
            video games and I hope to create one some day.

        <p>Ghana, located on the West African coast, is a culturally diverse nation with a rich history and a stable democracy since gaining independence in 1957. Its borders are defined by Cote d'Ivoire to the west, Burkina Faso to the north, and Togo to the east, while the south faces the Gulf of Guinea. These borders encompass a land of contrasts, from the lush forests of the south to the arid savannahs in the north, making it a geographically fascinating country. Ghana's friendly people, historic forts and castles, vibrant traditions, and stunning natural landscapes make it a captivating destination for travelers seeking both cultural immersion and breathtaking scenery..</p>
